This latest NEEAP updates the Third NEEAP (2014). It includes a range of new measures including:
The Warmth and Wellbeing scheme: A pilot initiative being delivered under the Government’s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty and the Healthy Ireland Framework. The objective of the pilot is to validate, in an Irish context, the international evidence that suggests making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have a positive effect on the health and wellbeing of people in energy poverty who are also living with a chronic respiratory condition such as COPD & Asthma
Deep Retrofit Pilot: This will operate from 2017 to establish how best to support deeper levels of renovation in the residential sector. While it will in itself deliver energy efficiency gains its main purpose will be to gain practical experience and insights on how best to encourage and support deeper residential energy efficiency offerings post 2020.
Energy Audits for Large Energy Users: Introduced in Ireland in 2015 in support of the objectives of Article 8 of the Directive.
Behvaioural Economics Unit: This dedicated new unit will be established in SEAI in 2017. Its objective is to better understand the behaviors and motivations of key decision makers when deciding on choices with energy efficiency potential and how those decisions might be more effectively influenced in favour of more energy efficiency outcomes.
Technical Bureau: A new unit is being established in SEAI to complement the range of programmes currently delivered by the organisation. This unit will have a particular focus on technical barriers, supports and solutions. The objective it so to catalyse greater and accelerated energy efficiency activity across targeted sectors. Two key pilots are being undertaken in 2017: Schools Sector and Central Government Buildings.
Energy Standards and Design (EXEED): The EXEED Certified Program was launched by SEAI during 2016. This provides a project-based standard for Energy Efficient Design Management in design of new investments. The objective is to minimise lifecycle energy consumption where energy performance is locked-in during this design timeframe.
DS3 System Services: The “Delivering a Secure Sustainable Electricity System (DS3)” programme aims to meet the challenge of operating the power system with up to 75% of instantaneous demand being met from windfarms by 2020. A key element of the programme, DS3 System Services, went live in 2016.

Specifically for BEMS and HEMS, METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) provides subsidies for introducing energy management systems in homes and buildings which help manage the energy consumption of appliances such as lighting, air-conditioning, and hot-water supply by using information technology systems. These systems enable automatic management of several appliances simultaneously, leading to energy savings and reduced environmental impact. Currently the BEM and HEMS subsidy program is implemented by Sustainable Open Innovation Initiative (SII) under the budget of METI.
The FY 26 budget of METI’s Agency of Natural Resources and Energy amounts to approximately 4 billion yen for the promotion of large-scale HEMS infrastructure development with the recognition as the continued key energy efficiency measure in the housing sector. Stipulated under the Basic Energy Plan of 2014, the number of HEMS application of approximately 10,000 households as the numerical target by the government. For BEMS, as the continued key energy efficiency measure in building sector, mentioned as the key technology as a part of the government’s actions on facilitating an innovative technology development stipulated under the Basic Energy Plan of 2014.

There has been a series of major revisions in 1993, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2013. The target sectors are all major sectors in Japan, such as industrial, residential, commercial, and transportation. The Act of the legislation is as follows:
I. Energy Conservation Act in 1979
The initial enactment of the Act concerns the two key energy efficiency policy and measures as follows:- Energy Management and Conservation Regulation for Designated Energy Management Factories
The Act introduced energy conservation and management regulation targeting factories with a large amount of energy consumption. The factories were designated as “Designated Energy Management Factories (“Type 1 Designated Energy Management Factories”)” by this Act and under this Act. The level of fuel consumption of a designated factory was set at the volume of annual fuel consumption equivalent to at least 3,000 kilolitre of crude oil or an annual electricity consumption of at least 12 GWh. And regulatory standards called “Judgment of Standards” were developed for the designated factories to refer when practicing energy management requirements. The key energy conservation and management measures are as follows:- To appoint an energy manager (who is qualified as a national license);- To report the status of energy consumption every year. The Act also introduced energy efficiency standards for vehicles, refrigerators, and air conditioners.
II. Revision in 1993
The revision of the Act in 1993 adopts a mandatory periodic report to be made by the designated energy management factories.
III. Revision in 1998
The revision of the Act concerns the four key new energy efficiency policy and measures as follows:
1) Creation of “Type 2 Designated Energy-Management Factories”The revision of the Act introduced a new designation of factories and business establishments. These factories are “Type 2 Designated Factories” with an annual fuel consumption equivalent to over 1,500 kilolitres of crude oil or annual electricity consumption over 6 GWh. The factories became obliged to appoint an energy manager and monitor the actual status of energy use in the factory or workplace.
2) New Obligation for “Type 1 Designated Energy-Management Factories”For the "Type 1 Designated Energy Management Factory", a new obligation was introduced by the revision. As a new obligation, the submission of a medium- to long-term report on energy conservation measures was introduced. Also, “an average of 1 % reduction of energy intensity in annual base during the mid and long term plan” was introduced as a regulatory energy management and efficiency target.
3) Creation of Top Runner ProgramThe revision of the Act also introduced the “Top-Runner Program”. This is a regulatory standard program targeting the improvement of energy efficiency of electrical appliances. The concept of the program is that the target standard is set at the weighted-average energy efficiency of each manufacturer’s and importer’s shipment to achieve the level of the most energy-efficient model in each category of the current market.
4) Stricter Penalty for NoncomplianceAlso with this revision, the level of the penalties was increased for non compliance. New penalties were: a publication of the name of the manufacturers and importers and an issuance of the administrative order for not meeting the standards.
IV. Revision in 2002
The revision of the Act in 2002 concerns the key new energy efficiency policy and measures as follows:1) The category of the type 1 Designated Energy Management Factory that had targeted five manufacturing industries was expanded to all industries.2) The revision obliges the type 2 designated energy management factories to make periodic reports.3) The revision obliges the designated buildings to report energy conservation measures.
V. Revision in 2005
The revision of the Act in 2005 concerns the four key new energy efficiency policy and measures as follows:
1) Creation of Regulation for TransportationThe revision of the Act concerns the promotion of energy efficiency in the transportation sector, targeting consigners and carriers (transportation enterprises, for both goods and passengers, and goods owners) for the transportation sector. Regulated consigners and carriers are called “Designated Consigners and Carriers” and the set of obligations is as follows:- To submit a periodic report,- To promote eco-driving- To appoint an energy manager
2) New Concept of Total Management of Heat and ElectricityBy this revision of the Act, a new concept of management of energy source was introduced. Before, the amount of used energy of electricity and heat used was counted respectively, but after the revision total amount of the energy consumption of heat and electricity was counted.
3) New Obligation for Energy Supplier and RetailerBy this revision of the Act, a new obligation was introduced targeting equipment retailer. By this obligation, retailers became imposed on an information provision for consumers.
4) Unified Energy Conservation Label”A new labeling was introduced of which label shows a star-rating. This is a comparative performance rating labeling of a product with the cost information such as expected electricity cost during the use of the product.
5) Creation of Regulation for Housing and BuildingThe revised act strengthened energy conservation measures for residential buildings and the construction sector. Owners of buildings larger than 2,000 m2 floor space must prepare efficiency plans when applying for renovation permits, as must contractors planning to build entirely new structures. The reporting on maintenance and preservation of energy conservation measures to prefectures or other building authorization officials became mandatory.
6) Expansion of Top Runner ProgramNewly, microwave oven, electric rice cooker, and DVD recorder became the Top Runner target products.
VI. Revision in 2008
The revision of the Act in 2008 concerns the key new energy efficiency policy and measures as follows:
1) Industry and Commercial Sectors- The revision introduces a system for energy management obligation per whole enterprise.- The revision treats a franchise chain such as convenience stores and restaurants also as a single enterprise, and applies the same regulation on the enterprise. (This revision imposed not only on in manufacturing factories but also on business sectors such as offices, convenience stores, etc.)
2) Building, Houses- This review strengthen measures for large residences and buildings(Introduction of orders in addition to instructions and notices)- This revision adopts a report on energy-saving methods by owners of small-medium-sized residences and buildings above a certain size.- This revision adopts energy-saving measures by businesses engaged in the construction and sales of residences (recommendations and orders for those who are engaged in the construction and sales of a large number of residences).- This revision promotes of indication of the energy saving performance of residences and buildings.
VII. Revision in 2013
The revision of the Act in 2013 was conducted for the purpose of enhancing energy conservation measures in the housing and building sectors. The key measures are as follows:
1) Top Runner Program for Building Materials, etc.The Top Runner Program has so far been applied to machinery and equipment that consume energy. This revision newly adds building materials, such as windows and heat insulating materials as Top Runner Program target products. Also, three phase induction motor and LED lamp were included for the revision.
2) Positive Evaluation of Action to Reduce Peak Demand ElectricityThe current evaluation and rating system of the report submitted by designated energy management factories, etc., required by the Energy Conservation Act was amended. Under this new evaluation and ratings system, the procedure was revised to positively evaluate and rate the electricity consumer’ efforts to reduce the use of power from utility grids during peak demand hours by using storage batteries, energy management systems (BEMS or HEMS), or private power generation, in addition to their conventional measures to save energy.
3) Abolition of the Rational Use of Energy and the Utilization of Recycled ResourcesBy this revision of the Act, the "Energy Conservation and Recycling Assistance Act" was abolished, as it is defined in the Act, “the Act shall be abolished by March 31, 2013.” (Sunset Act).
VIII. Current development
In 2016, Japanese government has decided to introduce new energy efficiency measures. The key components of new measures are as follows:
1) Thermal power generation facilitiesIn order to improve efficiency of thermal power generation facilities, Japanese government set new Judgment of Standard for new power generation facilities and new energy efficiency benchmarks for electric power generation business.
2) SABC evaluation system (S rank, A rank, B rank, C rank evaluation system)The government established new evaluation system for all Specified Business Operators, which categorizes business operators in accordance with the progress of energy efficiency. Under this evaluation system, the names of the excellent companies are publicized by the government.
3) Expansion of benchmark objectsCommercial sector is included in benchmark objects in order to promote energy efficiency. Benchmark objects used to be limited in industry sector.
4) Exploitation of unused heat sourcesCalculation method for evaluation of energy efficiency has changed so as to promote effective utilization of heat. In the case of using waste heat, business operators get special consideration in evaluating energy efficiency.

These include -
economic restructuring
energy efficiency improvement
vehicle emission standards
participation in international R&D programmes
development and utilisation of hydropower and other renewable energy
ecological restoration and protection
family planning
Many of these policies are from the eleventh five year plan, which runs from 2006 to 2011. The National Climate Change Programme also indicates challenges in lowering the countrys CO2 intensity, given its existing resources (abundant coal), the resulting lock-in of coal-based energy infrastructure, limited access to more efficient technologies and limited finance.
A key to the countries contribution to lower greenhouse gases is its official energy efficiency objective of reducing energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20% by 2010 and of quadrupling GDP between 2000 and 2020 while only doubling energy use. In addition to this general goal, the government is to take measures to close small, less efficient industrial facilities in sectors including iron and steel, cement, aluminium, copper, glass or ceramics.

The industries, which account for nearly 70% of energy consumption and sulfur dioxide discharges of the entire industrial sector, grew by 20.6% in the first quarter, 6.6% points higher than the same period a year earlier.
This plan aims to cut energy intensity by 20% by 2010, as well as cutting the discharge of major pollutants by 10%. This was to be completed by increasing renewable energy, export restrictions on energy intensive and high-pollution products, and pollution-reduction tax incentives; additionally government buildings switched to low-energy lighting and optimally efficient products and machines. Violation of these energy conservation laws can lead to criminal proceedings, and failure to meet targets was taken into account during government-employee and business-leader performance assessments.

When several purchasers of new energy efficient technology get together when making major purchases, unit prices tend to become lower, which in turn benefits subsequent buyers while promoting the market entrance of new technology. Such procurements mainly take place in heating, hot water, sanitary, ventilation, and lighting.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Swedish Energy Agency has partly financed and initiated networks for technology procurement, which have been designed to trigger the production of more energy efficient and and more environmentally friendly products and systems. The networks bring together a consortium of influental customers thus forming a single group of buyers. Currently there exists five more or less permanent procurement groups; BeLok ( for commercial spaces), BeBo (for landlords), HyLok (for the public sector when tenant), BeLivs (the enitre food-procesing chain), and BeSmå (for producers of single family homes). These groups also act as information exchange networks for the participants. The most recent addition to these groups is BeLivs, which started in 2011 with the aim of reducing energy use in premises where foodstuffs are being processed and sold. Related to these technology procurement groups are also networks with the aim of supporting the  development of passive houses and buildings with very low energy consumption (LÅGAN). Moreover, research projects such as Cerbof for long-term sustainable buildings also aim at the promotion of new solutions and technologies in the energy efficiency sector.

The fuel consumption tax NoVa was introduced in 1992. This tax has to be paid at the time of purchasing a new car and is based on the fuel consumption specifications of the car. The Structural Adjustment Act in 1996 led to an increase in this tax rate of about 1% by changing the way fuel consumption is measured. At the same time, the maximum tax rate was raised from 14% to 16%. Since the fuel consumption tax increases the tax burden depending on the vehicleâ€™s relative fuel consumption, this measure offers incentives for the purchase of energy-efficient vehicles. In recent years a strong trend towards diesel powered vehicles reduced the average fuel consumption. In 1996 diesel powered vehicles accounted for 50% of all new registrations compared to 22% before the introduction of the fuel consumption levy. Diesel vehicles currently hold a share of 40% to 50% of the total passenger vehicle fleet compared to 5% in the mid-1980s. The car registration tax has to be paid for each month in which a vehicle is registered and has a number-plate, the prerequisite to use public roads. The level of the tax depends on engine specification and it is paid to the insurance company together with the liability insurance premiums. The tax is then forwarded by the insurance company to the tax authority.

To address this issue, since 1995 government agencies including the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA), Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Health have implemented retrofit programmes to install insulation in inadequately insulated homes. In 2006, the EECA introduced a rental offer to landlords in which landlords had to be a member of the New Zealand Property Investors Federation. The subsequent 2007 scheme was opened to all applicants, providing tenants are eligible for a community services card and the property was built before 1978.
The Energywise Home Grants were made available for low income households to insulate their houses- including ceiling and under-floor insulation, draught proofing of doors and windows, hot water cylinder wraps and low flow shower heads. The Energywise Interest Subsidy was available for middle-income homeowners for an insulation retrofit and or a clean heat heating upgrade to their property. Since its establishment in 2005, Energywise Homes completed over 54,000 home insulation retrofits. EECA managed funding for programmes under the Energywise Homes Programme to assist lower-income and middle-income families to insulate their homes and to install clean efficient heating appliances. In addition to EECAs managed programmes, the Ministry for the Environment funded the Clean Heat Programme, which was available to low income households in areas with local air quality constraints and involves removing inefficient heaters and replacing them with clean, efficient and sufficiently sized heating appliances.
This programme was superseded by the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart programme.

These objectives fix the direction of French energy policy for the next 30 years. To meet these goals regardless of future economics, the French government seeks to: - Manage domestic energy demand - Diversify the sources of energy supply - Develop new energy technology - Ensure the networks of transport and energy storage To guide the application of this framework, France has set for itself quantitative goals and defined several programs to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy: - Support for the international objective of a reduction by half of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions before 2050. For France, among other industrialized nations, this entails an emissions reduction of 4 to 5 times current levels. - The annual reduction between now and 2015 of French energy intensity by 2%, and between now and 2030 by 2.5% - Renewable energies satisfaction of 10% of French energy demand by 2010. Specifically, this entails the development of thermic energy sources by 50% before 2010 and the fuel mix incorporation of biofuels by 2% before 2006 and 5.75% before 2011. - Establishment of 3 principle programs of energy efficiency and renewable energy development: 1. Energy For Development: to extend access to energy services to developing nations 2. Southern Face: to encourage the installation of 200,000 solar water-heaters and 50,000 solar roofs each year from 2010 3. Earth Energy: to have reduced French oil imports by at least 10 million tonnes in 2010 by replacing such fuel needs with heat and fuel produced from biomass. Nuclear: The Energy Framework rests on the maintenance of Frances nuclear power, and establishes plans to construct new nuclear reactors. Energy Technology R&D: The government will publish its domestic research strategy, to be revised every 5 years, and report each year to the Parliament regarding development of renewable energies and energy efficiency programs. To enact its policies of energy efficiency and technology R&D, the French government has endowed the National Research Agency with ?350 million and the Industrial Innovation Agency with ?1 billion in 2005. These grants fund the development of energy-efficient technology and a sweeping industrial policy. New Practical Measures The 2005 Energy Framework contains several practical measures to realise Frances general energy goals. Beyond the transposition of many of the EUs legislative Directives (in particular, 2002/91/CE on the energy performance of buildings and 2004/101/EC, the EUs Linking Directive), the French goverment has established several domestic programs: - White Certificate Program to encourage energy efficiency among firms in the energy sector. Under such a scheme, participants must identify potential efficiencies within the energy supply chain. - Support for regional and municipal programs of energy management, especially when conducted in aggregate. - Information campaigns targetting both schoolchildren and consumers, coupled with new regulations requiring energy providers to publicize energy efficient aspects of their commerce. - Creation of a guarantee of origin system for renewable energy. For hydropower, a law favoring low-volume turbines and a feed-in tariff for thus-produced power. For wind energy, an extension of already-favorable financial treatment and a close examination of sites for future expansion. For geothermal energy, a multi-year investment program. - Measures to guarantee the supply of electricity and gas. - Creation of a High

The incentives are provided in the form of a discount obtained by consumers directly from the dealers, who in turn receive this as a tax credit. A bonus of EUR 1500 is provided when a car older than 9 years meeting Euro 0, 1 or 2 standards is exchanged for a new vehicle meeting Euro 4 or 5 standards and that emits a maximum of 130gCO2/km for diesel cars or 140gCO2/km for others. The exchanged vehicle must have been registered by March 2010. This can be combined with a purchase incentive of EUR 1500 should the new vehicle run on electricity, hydrogen or methane. This purchase incentive rises to EUR 3000 if the vehicle emits 120gCO2/km, and to EUR 3500 if it emits less than that.

Departments will also reduce the use of energy-intensive consumables such as paper by 10%. In March 2009 the Carbon Neutral Public Service programme was discontinued. However, Government signalled its expectations that chief executives of all public service departments would continue to take practical action to reduce their impacts on the environment where it makes economic sense. This would include taking a "whole of life" approach when procuring goods and services; minimising waste sent to landfills; using resources, including energy and water, more efficiently; improving planning, design and construction when commissioning and operating buildings; and adopting transport policies that minimise their environmental impact.

JESSICA loan (maturity up to 20 years at fixed annual interest rate of 3 %) is offered to the owners of apartments or other premises in a multi-apartment buildings, provided they commit themselves to implement energy efficiency measures which would result in (i) achieving at least 20 % of energy savings as compared to the baseline and (ii) meeting at least the energy efficiency Class D requirements. If these targets are met, the beneficiaries qualify for a “bonus” – an interest subsidy which equals to 15 % of loan principal. At the end of 2011 the Lithuanian Parliament introduced an additional incentive to compensate additional 15 % of investment cost, provided the overall calculated energy savings reach at least 30 % as compared to the baseline (the Law on the State Support for the Acquisition or Rent of housing and for the Modernization of multifamily buildings of the Republic of Lithuania amended on the 11th of October, 2011).
Currently the additional improvement of this program is introduced. By the amendments of the Law on support for buying or renting dwellings given by the Government of the Republic of Lithuania, adopted on 17 January 2013, the municipalities are more involved in the renovation process of the multi-apartment buildings. The municipality appoints one responsible entity which may take the loan for renovation on preferential conditions.

Australia revised the BCA to account for energy efficiency as part of its strategic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
To complement passage of the housing provisions, Australian governments agreed to implement a consistent Nation-wide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) to enable householders to assess the energy efficiency of houses and make more informed choices about housing purchases and renovation.
The Commonwealth Government administers NatHERS on behalf of States and Territories.
Energy efficiency provisions for detached and semi-detached dwellings were included in the BCA on 1 January 2003. From 1 May 2006, the provisions were increased to a nominal 5 star NatHERS rating. In April 2009 the Council of Australian Governments requested the ABCB to increase the standard for new residential buildings in the BCA to a six-star NatHERS energy rating or equivalent, and include standards for water heaters and lighting. These measures were successfully incorporated into the BCA 2010 edition.  All measures were subject to regulatory impact analysis.
Since the BCA is a performance based Code, builders and designers have the option of meeting these standards in one of two ways:
by following the prescriptive "deemed-to-satisfy" provisions; or
by achieving the required house energy rating using an accredited software tool.

The Region organises several training programmes for energy managers in public buildings, teachers in vocational schools for carpenters and bricklayers to improve the quality of thermal insulation, and for architects. A handbook for energy managers has been published. A CD-ROM on lighting efficiency design is being prepared. A Newsletter, "Le REActif" (Le Responsable Energie Actif), which is targeted at the tertiary sector, is published, but specific information is designed for the industrial sector. The Region also has kiosks providing information on energy savings for heating, thermal insulation of buildings and lighting in small and medium-sized enterprises. The RUE Broker programme, aimed at SMEs, includes: - In agreement with the SME, the RUE Broker analyses the energy balance of the enterprise and detects the major problems. He proposes solutions and provides information about the incentives and accompanying measures available from the Walloon Region. - In a few cases, the RUE Broker makes a deeper analysis (Energy Potential Scan method, which was developed in the Netherlands) and proposes more elaborate solutions. - This action is sustained 100% by the Walloon Region, the SME assuming responsibility for its own human and material participation. COGENSUD is a non-profit organisation in charge of the promotion of combined heat and power (CHP) within the Walloon Region. Flanders VIREG (Vlaamse Instelling voor het Rationeel Energieverbruik, Flemish Institute for the Rational Use of Energy (RUE)), created in September 1997, seeks to involve actively the different actors in RUE policy, to co-ordinate Flemish initiatives in the field of RUE and ensure that available funds are used in the best possible way. More particularly, the tasks of VIREG are to determine the energy saving potential within the Region, plan and executive concrete actions in energy efficiency and monitor these actions. One of the most important actions of VIREG is the annual organisation of the "month of RUE" in October. VITO (Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologisch Onderzoek, Flemish Institute for Technological Research) raises energy awareness in the industrial sector and among the public through the Information System on Energy and Environmental (EMIS). Flanders has also established energy efficiency consultancy departments for small and medium-sized enterprises in each of the five regional development companies. The Flemish Energy Agency subsidizes federations and organisations for carrying out energy consultancy and information activities directed towards SMEs and citizens.

The Energy Policy is a component of Slovakia's national economic strategy given that ensuring sustainable economic growth is conditioned by the reliable supply of price-competitive energy.
The Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic (Ministry of Economy) is responsible for completing the Energy Policy for a minimum period of 20 years and updating it on a five-year cycle at a minimum pursuant to Section 88 of Act No. 251/2012 Coll. on Energy and on amendment of certain acts as amended by Act No. 391/2012 Coll. (Act No. 251/2012 Coll. on Energy). Economic development, new trends in the liberalisation of energy markets in the European Union (EU), new legislation and the new EU energy policy also required an update of the Energy Policy adopted in 2006.
The Energy Policy is intended to ensure the sustainability of the Slovak energy sector to contribute to the sustainable growth of the national economy and its competitiveness. The priority from this perspective is ensuring the reliability and stability of energy supply, efficient energy utilisation at optimum costs and ensuring environmental protection.
A well-functioning energy market with a competitive environment will be strengthened by Energy Policy implementation. The task of the Energy Policy is to create a stable framework for a safely operating energy market that spurs on investments into energy. The Energy Policy is focused on the public as well as the private sector. It responds to the interests of customers and end users in order to maximise the exploitation of the advantages offered by a liberalised and secure energy market.
The Energy Policy complies with the primary objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon and is based on the fundamental European goals for energy outlines in the Europe 2020 strategy.
Slovakia is among a group of vulnerable countries with respect to energy security, and therefore it supports an energy architecture that creates the conditions for increasing energy self-sufficiency, pro-export capacity in electricity, transparency and optimisation of the energy mix with low-carbon technologies and increasing energy efficiency in the interests of stability, the development of the national economy and the interests of customers and their protection.
Close cooperation between the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe is key with respect to increasing the energy security of the entire region and is the driving force for Slovakia's active involvement in the creation of trans-European energy infrastructure, in particular in cooperation with Visegrád Four (V4) countries.
The Energy Policy emphasises the optimum use of domestic energy sources and low-carbon technologies such as renewable energy sources (RES) and nuclear energy. 
A major milestone in the Slovak energy sector was the implementation of the Third Energy Package of the European Parliament and of the Council and directives concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and gas upon the adoption of the Energy Act and the Act on Regulation of Network Industries at the end of July 2012.

The recent enacted Energy Law No. 30 of August 2007 that is discussed below creates a National Energy Council chaired by the President with the authority to design and formulate energy policy on behalf of the GOI; the policy then must be endorsed by Parliament. This is a recent development and has not as yet introduced any change in the content of energy policy.
The objectives of the present energy policy are, by 2025:
1) To reduce significantly the use of oil to below 20%;
2) To increase the use of :
coal from 15.7% to more than 33%;
liquefied coal to more than 2%;
natural gas from 23% to more than 30%;
geothermal from 1.9% to more than 5%;
biofuel to more than 5%;
other renewable energy (RE) from 0.5% to more than 5%;
Â 
3) To reduce energy elasticity to below 1; and
4) To improve energy infrastructure.
The main programmes envisaged to achieve these targets are all supply-side, namely:
increasing oil production by optimisation of existing fields, enhanced oil recovery, and offering new acreages;
development of 10 000 MW of coal fired power plant by 2009;
development of bio-energy and opening 6 million hectares of new planta.

The “SBO” (Strategic Basic Research) programme of IWT supports strategic basic research projects (situated between fundamental research and the more specifically focused applied research) performed by all Flemish R&D actors (universities, colleges of higher education, companies, collective centres and research centres established in the Flemish Region) and all Flemish universities or colleges of higher education in the Brussels Capital Region. 

Within the above mentioned funding programmes a Regulation with regard to Sustainable Technological Development is integrated. All projects focussing on sustainable technological development get a priority ranking and a subsidy bonus.</td><td class="views-field views-field-field-cluster">To be classified</td></tr><tr><td>108</td><td>3206</td><td>2007</td><td>LUX</td><td>Obligation to blend biofuels in transport</td><td>Biofuels for transport</td><td>REPolicyType</td><td class="hidden2 views-field views-field-body">The budget law 2007 sets the mandatory part of biofuel to be blended in diesel and gasoline in tranport to 2%.

Related State Climate and Energy Partnership Program resources include the publication of Best Practices Guides. The first US guide to Best Practices, the Clean Energy-Environment Guide to Action: Policies, Best Practices, and Action Steps for States (April 2006) provides in-depth information about 16 clean energy policies and programmes that states are using to meet their energy, environmental, and economic objectives. States have found that these 16 clean energy policies and programmes offer numerous opportunities to save energy, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve system reliability and security, and enhance economic development. The Guide to Action is intended for use by state energy, environment, and economic policymakers and public utility commissions. The Guide to Action details states experiences with cost-effective clean energy policies and strategies. The guide covers energy efficiency, clean energy supply and clean distributed generation. The Guide to Action is one part of a package of planning, policy, technical, analytical, and information resources EPA provides to help state partners establish and implement sound action plans. EPA also tracks and disseminates successful state clean energy policies and provides opportunities for training and peer exchange. At the time of the guides launch, there existed a "Clean Energy-Environment State Partnership" (launched February 2005) involving 12 states: North Carolina, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Under the current State and Local Climate and Energy Program, the "State Climate and Energy Partner Network" helps state energy, environmental, and utility staff understand and explore climate change and clean energy policy and programme opportunities. The partner network provides up?to?date information about state activities and fosters communication among state decision makers on climate and energy issues and opportunities.

The aim of this strategy is to enable the EU to meet the twin objectives of increasing security of energy supply and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. An assessment of the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and the progress made in the last 10 years shows that more and better use could be made of renewables. In accordance with Directive 2001/77/EC, all Member States have adopted national targets for the proportion of electricity consumption from renewable energy sources. If all Member States meet their national targets, 21% of total electricity consumption in the EU will be produced from renewable energy sources by 2010. Although some Member States are on track to meet their target, the majority of States appear to be behind schedule, and the EU will only manage to produce 19% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2010. Additional efforts are therefore required. In 2005, the breakdown of renewable energy sources for electricity production in the EU was as follows: 66.1% from hydropower, 16.3% from wind power, 15.8% from biomass, 1.2% from geothermal energy and 0.3% from solar power (thermal and photovoltaic). The 5.75% target for the contribution of biofuels to total fuel consumption by 2010, set on the basis of Directive 2003/30/EC , is unlikely to be met unless current policies are strengthened. Only two Member States met the intermediate target of 2% for the contribution of biofuels by 2005. In 2005, biodiesel accounted for 81.5% of total biofuel production in the EU, while bioethanol accounted for 18.5%. The Commission is of the opinion that the heating and cooling sector, which accounts for approximately 50% of final energy consumption, is insufficiently exploiting the potential of renewable energy sources, which contributed less than 10% of the energy used for heating or cooling in 2005. The EU has not so far adopted any legislation with the direct aim of promoting heating or cooling from renewable sources. In the Road Map, the Commission proposes setting a mandatory target of 20% for renewable energys share of energy consumption in the EU by 2020 and a mandatory minimum target of 10% for biofuels. Each Member State will have to adopt mandatory targets and action plans in line with its potential. These action plans must include specific measures and objectives for the three following sectors: electricity, biofuels and heating and cooling. This flexible approach is designed to leave Member States sufficient room for manoeuvre.</td><td class="views-field views-field-field-cluster">To be classified</td></tr><tr><td>133</td><td>2787</td><td>0</td><td>THA</td><td>Small and Very Small Power Purchase Agreements</td><td>Onshore;Biomass for power;Hydropower;CHP</td><td>REPolicyType</td><td class="hidden2 views-field views-field-body">Intiated following the amendment of the EGAT (Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand ) Act, the small power producer (SPP) purchase agreements were meant to initiate private participation in power sector development. The objectives of purchasing electricity from SPPs were: * to reduce the financial burden on the government of electricity generation and distribution; * to encourage participation by private producers in electricity generation; * to promote the use of indigenous by-product energy sources and renewable energies for electricity generation; * to promote the more efficient use of primary energy. The source of SPP generation must be from: * non-conventional energy such as wind, solar and mini-hydro energy; * waste or by-products from agricultural and industrial activities; * co-generation using natural gas or petroleum products under a number of conditions. At the end of 1996, there were 17 SPP contracts, three firm and 14 non-firm, with a total installed capacity of 910 MW. About 370 MW was sold to the national grid. Regulations on power purchase provisions from Very Small Renewable Energy Power Producers (VSREPP) were approved in May 2002. They allow for net metering and a streamlined interconnection process to minimise VSREPP connecting costs. A VSREPP is defined as a generator 1) with its own generating unit 2) which utilises renewable energy sources, agricultural and industrial wastes and residues, or by-product steam 3) which sells no more than 1 MW of electrical power to a distribution utility. There are fewer than 24 VSPP generators currently in operation and a total cumulative capacity of about 2 MW. Though they are insignificant in terms of the countrys energy production, they play an important role in promoting the participation of small generators in power generation, decentralising energy production and promoting the efficient use of domestic resources that are environmentally friendly.</td><td class="views-field views-field-field-cluster">To be classified</td></tr><tr><td>134</td><td>2772</td><td>2016</td><td>CHN</td><td>China 13th Bioenergy Development Five Year Plan (2016-2020) </td><td>Bioenergy</td><td>REPolicyType</td><td class="hidden2 views-field views-field-body">The China 13th Five Year Plan (2016-2020) on Bioenergy was released by the National Energy Administration (NEA) on 5 December 2016.

The draft version of this document was in consultation until 30th of March 2018. 
The draft version of the document contains mandatory provincial-level quotas of renewable electricity over total electricity and specific non-hydropower renewable electricity quotas accompanied by “Renewable Electricity Certificate” system. Quotas are being established for the year 2018 and year 2020. 
The new system assigns electricity users including grid companies, electricity retail companies, and large end-users participating in direct power purchasing a percentage quota of their electricity that needs to come from renewable energy. Users can prove they have fulfilled the obligations by buying renewable energy certificates (RECs), which are issued to renewable generators for each megawatt-hour (MWh) they produce. There will be separate renewable obligations for hydropower and other renewable energy (wind, solar, biomass). Users with an insufficient number of RECs at the year-end will be obligated to buy replacement RECs at a price proposed by power grid enterprises and filed with the National Development and Reform Commission. 
The calculation of quota considers several factors. They include are newly added renewable power installed capacity and electricity, renewable curtailment rates, inter-regional and inter-provincial power transmission capacity, power load estimation and market trading volume. 
For provinces which do not achieve the quota, the energy administrative departments will cut or temporarily postponed provincial fossil power construction quota, and they are not able to apply demonstration projects. For market users which do not achieve the quota, the government will cancel or reduce the amount of allowed market trading volume for the next year. If they refuse to implement renewable obligation, these users will be listed in bad credit file and get punishment.

The Fund is administered by the Hungarian Credit Bank. Its scope has been expanded to include municipalities. The main objectives are to replace traditional energy sources with renewable or waste-related energy sources, to induce energy saving in businesses and to reduce energy waste at the lowest possible cost. The preferential interest is one-third of the central bank?s base rate with an additional 2.5% interest. From 1991 to 2002 the total amount of investments approved for ?live projects? was HUF 14.4 billion, of which HUF 11.9 billion was made up of preferential credits. In 2000, the GCARF allocated more than HUF 1 billion in preferential credit for SMEs, which resulted in energy savings of 325 TJ per year and total investment of HUF 1.6 billion. In 2001, a total of HUF 0.89 billion was spent on renewable investments from preferential credit. In 2002, the amount of the preferential credit was increased to HUF 1.51 billion.

The Tariff Policy included certain provisions regarding renewable energy and cogeneration. The appropriate electricity commission is to fix a minimum percentage for purchase of energy from these sources, taking into account resource availability and impact on tariffs. Percentages for energy purchase were made applicable for tariffs to be determined by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) by 1 April 2006. Procurement by distribution companies is to be done at preferential tariffs, determined by the appropriate commission, to encourage non-conventional energy technologies to eventually compete with conventional ones. Such procurement is to be done through a competitive bidding process. In cases where procurement is not through competitive bidding, the Central Commission is to lay down guidelines for pricing non-firm power, particularly from non-conventional sources. Non-firm power refers to power supplied under a commitment having limited or no assured availability.
The new policy was developed in accordance with frameworks established by The Electricity Act 2003 and the National Electricity Policy. In order to attract investment to the sector the policy aims to:
 

Ensure availability of the electricity to consumers  at a reasonable and competitive rate
Ensure financial viability of the sector and attract investments
Promote transparency, consistency, and predictability in regulatory approaches across jurisdictions and minimise perceptions of regulatory risks
Promote competition efficiency in operations and improvement in quality of supply

This outlook presents the ideal structure of energy supply and demand for 2030 that can be realized if appropriate measures are taken to achieve the fundamental objectives of energy policy: safety, energy security, economic efficiency and environmental protection.
Energy efficiency and renewable energy plays a key role in achieving all these objectives because they can contribute to energy independence, to the reduction of oil and gas imports and to the reduction of greenhouse gas emission.
According to this new plan, the final energy demand should save as much as 50.3 billion liters (crude oil equivalent) by 2030. By sector, savings from transport will amount to 16,070 thousand kilo liters, followed by commercial at 12,260 thousand kilo liters, residential sector 11,600 thousand kilo liters and industry at 10,420 thousand kilo liters. Those figures indicate that 35% improvement of final energy intensity needs to be achieved from 2012 to 2030. Renewable electricity generation would be 237-252 TWh, and its share in total electricity generation would be 22-24% in 2030: solar PV 7.0%, wind 1.7%, biomass 3.7-4.6%, geothermal 1.0-1.1% and hydro 8.8-9.2%.

The Paper is a strategy document identifying problems in Chinese energy sector and providing plan to further develop its energy supply system in order to meet ever growing energy demand.
The White Paper consists of nine chapters. Chapter number four is devoted to the new and renewable energy development.
Target:
China plans to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to 11.4 % and increase that of installed generating capacity from non-fossil fuels to 30 % by the end of 2015.
Vigorously developing new and renewable energy is a key strategic measure for promoting the diversified and clean energy development and for fostering new strategic industries, China will actively develop hydropower, solar power and wind power generation, seek safe and efficient ways of developing nuclear power, as well as utilize biomass energy and other types of renewable energy.
 
China will stress both intensive and distributed exploitation, and optimize the development layout of wind power. It will push forward wind power construction in an orderly way in the north-western, northern and north-eastern regions, which boast abundant wind energy, and speed up the development and utilization of distributed resources.
Developing and utilizing biomass energy, using crop stalks, grain-processing residues and bagasse as fuels in major producing areas of grain and cotton; and carefully develop woody biomass power generation in forest-covered areas.
China aims to large on-grid photovoltaic power stations and solar power generation projects in Qinghai and Gansu provinces, and the Xinjiang Uygur and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions, which boast abundant solar energy and scattered plots of unutilized land, for the purpose of increasing local supplies of electricity.
China will energetically develop distributed energy resources on the principle of giving priority to local supply, feeding the surplus into the grid, development based on local conditions, and accelerate the construction of distributed energy systems (DES) for natural gas at energy load centers.
By 2015, the nation is aiming to establish a total of 200 green-energy counties and 1,000 villages using solar energy as demonstrations.

To do so, emergency measures ranging form 2011 to 2013 have been taken by the Cabinet of Ministers. The main measures are: - As of January 1st 2011, electricity generators from both special and ordinary regimes will be required to pay a fee of a value equal to EUR 0.50/MWh for electricity fed into the grid. - As already witnessed for wind and thermal power installations, the number of equivalent hours of solar photovolatic generated electricity eligible for government support is limited. Once that limit is reached, the excess electricity generated by that particular installation during that particular year will not be supported and will be sold at the wholesale electricity market price. Between 2011 and 2013, the share of equivalent hours will remain as established in the Renewable Energy Plan 2005- 2010 and concerned power stations will then enjoy three extra years of Government support, scaling up the support period from 25 to 28 years.</td><td class="views-field views-field-field-cluster">To be classified</td></tr><tr><td>164</td><td>3328</td><td>2013</td><td>USA</td><td>US Climate Action Plan</td><td>Multiple RE Sources</td><td>REPolicyType</td><td class="hidden2 views-field views-field-body">On 25 June 2013, US President Barack Obama presented the US Climate Action Plan for steady, responsible national and international action to cut the GHG emissions that cause climate change and threaten public health. The plan has three pillars:

cut carbon pollution in the United States;
prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change;
lead international efforts to combat global climate change and prepare for its impacts.

 Each pillar in the plan consists of a wide variety of executive actions the president can take.
 The key mitigation elements are numerous:

to cut CO2 pollution from coal-fired power plants by directing the US Environmental Protection Agency to establish carbon pollution standards for both new and existing power plants;
to unlock long-term investment in clean energy innovation by making up to USD 8 billion in loan guarantee authority available for a wide array of advanced energy projects that use fossil fuels;
to accelerate clean energy permitting by: directing the US Department of the Interior to permit 10 gigawatts (GW) of renewables on public lands by 2020; setting a goal to install 100 megawatts of renewables in federally assisted housing by 2020 [in July 2015, HUD and the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced an expansion of the renewable energy goal for low and moderate income housing to 300 MW]; and deploying 3 GW of renewables in military installations;
to expand the federal government’s Better Building Challenge to focus on helping commercial, industrial, and multi-family buildings become at least 20% more energy efficient by 2020;
to reduce CO2 pollution by at least 3 billion metric tonnes cumulatively by 2030 through efficiency standards for appliances and federal buildings;
to increase fuel economy standards by developing post-2018 fuel economy standards for heavy-duty vehicles;
to leverage new opportunities to reduce pollution of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), direct agencies to develop a comprehensive methane strategy and commit to protect forests and critical landscapes.

 The key climate resilience and preparedness elements also address several goals:

to build stronger and safer communities and infrastructure by directing agencies to support local climate-resilient investment, and integrate climate risk-management considerations into planning and programmes;
to pilot innovative strategies in the Hurricane Sandy-affected region to support resilience and reduce vulnerability to future large-scale flood and storm events;
initiate the creation of sustainable and resilient hospitals in the face of climate change;
to protect the US economy and natural resources by directing agencies to: identify approaches to improve natural defences against extreme weather; maintain agricultural productivity by delivering tailored, science-based knowledge to farmers, ranchers, and landowners; help communities manage drought-related risk by launching a National Drought Resilience Partnership; and expand and update efforts to reduce wildfire risks and prepare for future floods;
to provide climate preparedness tools and information needed by state, local, and private-sector leaders through a centralised “toolkit” and a new Climate Data Initiative.

 Key objectives of the international elements are equally ambitious:

to enhance and expand international initiatives through forums such as the Major Economies Forum and the Clean Energy Ministerial, identifying new areas for bilateral co-operation;
to combat short-lived climate pollutants, such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and black carbon through the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, Global Methane Initiative, and working under the Montreal Protocol to phase down the consumption and production of HFCs;
to expand clean energy use by promoting natural gas development and fuel switching, the safe and secure use of nuclear power, and clean coal technologies;
to cut energy waste by aggressively promoting energy efficiency in critical areas such as buildings, wastewater treatment and appliances;
to launch negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) towards global free trade in environmental goods, including clean energy technologies;
to phase-out US fossil fuel tax subsidies, and collaborate with partners around the world toward this goal;
to end US government support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, except for the most efficient coal technology available in the world’s poorest countries, or facilities deploying carbon capture and sequestration technologies;
to strengthen global resilience to climate change by expanding government and local community planning and response capacities;
to lead efforts to address climate change through international negotiations, seeking an agreement that is ambitious, inclusive and flexible.

The TBC applies to new construction, except for technically simple structures of negligible constructional consequence not designated for residential or public use.The TBC also applies to the extension, modification, alteration or renovation works that are carried out on existing buildings. The Technical Code includes a set of Basic Documents, BD, for complying with the its basic requirements. These documents are to be updated in accordance with technical advancements and social requirements, and shall be approved regularly. Among the various BD is the Basic Energy Saving Document, which aims to obtain a rational use of energy required for buildings, reducing their consumption to sustainable limits, and ensuring that part of this consumption comes from renewable sources of energy, thanks to their design, construction, use and maintenance characteristics. The IDAE took part in its drafting and editing, acting as an advisor to the Ministry of Housing.

However, this mision is not unequivocally defined (e.g. can hybrid vehicles be interpreted as independent of fossil fuels). The Swedish taxation system supports the purchase of environment-friendly vehicles through a tax exemption throughout the first five years. This incentive has been strengthened with the introduction of an extra subsidy for “super environment-friendly” cars emitting less than 50 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilometre, which targets plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles. To promote alternative fuels, high-ratio blends of renewables into gasoline and diesel (E85, ED95 and biodiesel – 100% Fatty Acid Methyl Ester [FAME]) are subject to a full tax exemption. In addition, pumping stations which sell more than 1 000 cubic metres per year are required to offer a renewable fuel (e.g. E85). With regards to low-ratio blends into gasoline and diesel, there is no obligation today. However, in May 2014 the  introduced blending obligations which aim at an increased level of low blending. The law also introduced a specific sub-quota for advanced biofuels. Low-ratio blends of renewables have so far been incentivised through the general tax exemption on biofuels and the CO2 tax imposed on those sectors not covered by European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme. Another government priority has been research, development and deployment of clean vehicles (including a demonstration programme for e-mobility) and advanced biofuels, with the focus on the production of biofuels based on feed-stocks originating from forestry. In 2012, Sweden reached the binding European Union (EU) target that by 2020, the share of renewable energy in the transport sector should be 10%. The national long-term priority for 2030 is more ambitious than this target; a special committee was  established to investigate the options for facilitating development in line with the vision for 2030. The committee, which involved relevant stakeholders, presented its conclusions in December 2013. It suggested a broad range of measures, because one or a few policy intsruments will not be enough for reaching this goal. Thus, also e.g. new approaches to spatial planning will be required.

The subsidy averages between 25% (energy efficiency) and 50% (renewable energy). Energy Performance Advice (EPA) is a consultation that can be requested by an association of owners, landlords and tenants, to improve the energy performance of their dwellings or offices. The consultation is performed by a certified company, and lists the possible measures to be taken. If the advice is neglected, a bill is presented. Should one or more of the measures be carried out, EPA pays the bill, and EPR will subsidise part of the cost. In addition, EPA adds a bonus of 10% (for individuals) to 25% (for housing co-operatives and landlords) to the EPR premium. Both measures are financed by means related to the energy tax (REB). The mechanism thus encourages energy efficiency. One of the requirements for using EPA and EPR is that the consumer pays REB. Due to general government budget cut backs, energy efficient equipment will no longer be subsidised by the EPR from 2004.

The Ministry of Economic Development sets energy prices, which are implemented by most local bodies with minor adaptations. However, electricity pricing is a little nore diffused for the provincial utility companies that determine electricity tariffs which are then approved by the Maldives Energy Authority.The lack of a proper regulatory mechanism has led to non-cost reflective price, making it difficult for companies that operate in the energy sector to become financially feasible. In addition, non-targeted subsidization of electricity production in the past has diverted the states scarce financial resources. The pricing policies need to be reviewed regularly action has to be taken against non-compliance under this policy.
Strategies:

Empower Maldives Energy Authority (MEA) to regulate the energy sector and the pricing policy.
Formulate and implement pricing strategies to achieve a cost-reflective pricing policy for all commercial energy products including electricity.
Formulate and implement optimal energy supply expansion plans for the energy sector to ensure cost-reflective prices.

Major Aim: To regulate pricing policy and ensure cost-reflective prices in the energy products.
Achievement: To encourage the investments in renewable energy sector for power generation, feed-in tariff was introduced in 2011. A modified feed-in tariff will be introduced for large scale installations taking into consideration cost-based compensation for RE generation, with different prices offered to different technologies, project sizes and regions. In addition, the government is also planning to allow customers who generate electricity using a RE source, to connect their facility to the distribution network under a Net Metering scheme. MEA is now working on drafting the net metering scheme.
Stakeholders: The Maldives Energy Authority(MEA) is the main body for regulatory work. Regulations will be made after consulting with the stakeholders and after appropriate researches. Also the pricing mechanism and regulations will be made in compliance with the existing policies.
Time Frame: This is a general policy with no particular time frame.

The electricity access section of the project is divided into two main phases:

From 2002 to 2009, the programme tackles grid extension in rural areas close to urban centres.
From 2009 to 2012, it will legally and financially support independent power producers investing in renewable energy-based mini-grid systems in concentrated but remote settlement areas with a potential for electricity use by rural enterprises.

During this phase, the programme will also emphasise solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies by providing installation grants for small PV systems in remote areas, as well as technical assistance and support for business development.
Grants are provided for the installation of: 20, 000 Small Solar Home systems and 2, 000 large PV systems with a total capacity of around 2 MWp. Funding will also develop 10, 000 biogas plants and increase biofuel production nationwide.

This was motivated by environmental concerns and the wish to encourage energy efficiency. Construction of new electricity generating capacity must be justified by the need for new heat production capacity. District heat accounts for approximately 50% of Denmarks heat demand, compared to 30% in 1980. The average connection rate in district heating areas is 82% and is still increasing. The district heating network supplies heat not only to large consumers, apartment blocks and institutions but also to a large extent to modern single-family houses. In 1996 average distribution losses were 20%. In 1999, almost 80% of all district heat was produced from CHP plants, up from just under 40% in 1980. In 1999, almost 50% of electricity generation was from CHP, compared to just under 20% in 1980. Twelve of the 14 largest power stations in Denmark deliver all or part of their surplus heat to a district heating network. Nearly all large-scale power plants are located close to major cities. This and the fact that 80% of the population lives in urban areas allowed the combined development of district heating and CHP. The conditions for industrial CHP were less favourable as Danish industry is dominated by small and medium-sized companies with relatively low energy demand. Ten major cities now have city-wide district heating systems where almost all of the heat (95 to 98%) is produced in large coal-fired or gas-fired CHP plants and waste incineration plants, with a number of small oil-fired or gas-fired heat-only units for peak-load and emergency.</td><td class="views-field views-field-field-cluster">To be classified</td></tr><tr><td>191</td><td>3133</td><td>0</td><td>KEN</td><td>The National Energy</td><td>Multiple RE Sources</td><td>REPolicyType</td><td class="hidden2 views-field views-field-body">The National Energy policy is in its 5th Draft as at August 2011.
